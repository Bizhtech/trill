                <h3 class="my-3">Team Channels</h3>
                <p>Channels are the medium where ideas are filtered, and designs are executed. Casbn team channels has been designed with attractive features that drive communication and increase productivity. You have the flexibility to categorize your audience and have various and multiple channels when using Casbn. For example, you could create a public channel if you needed to communicate to all members of the organization globally or if you wish to share an information with everyone. Or, you could create a private channel for specific teams within your organization to share information that is only specific to certain group of people. A channel each for finance, marketing, manufacturing, and so on. Communication is an integral part of any business or organization. To uphold this integrity emails alone are not sufficient. Casbn is an advanced communication platform that brings together the messenger, audio and video calling, screen sharing, whiteboarding, and many such features under a single platform, making the communication more efficient and user-friendly.</p>
                <h3 class="my-3">Team Channel Task</h3>
                <p>With Team Channels Task feature you could break down the high-end tasks into subtasks and prioritize them according to the timelines and due dates with no necessity to sit together in a room and collaborate face-to-face. Once the tasks have been allocated to the team, each team member can: </p>
                
                <h3>Team Channel Project </h3>
                <p>The Team Channel Project feature allows you to divide the requirements of a specific project into different categories. This helps in segregating the tasks to each team, following which you can assign privileged access to specific teams to access the documents and every information about the project they are associated with. The project details screen enables you to edit the name of the project, choose the audience for the project, create team pages, and to choose a layout or a list for the project screen. A wide range of custom templates are available to choose from. These templates can be edited based on your requirements. Other features allow you to give a project description under a column, duplicating the project or exporting your project to another team, layout structuring, template conversion, and archiving and deleting the project. Moving project data from one team to another is a tedious task. It would require you to create a new project altogether and manually add all the existing information onto the new platform. Casbn makes it easy for you in exporting the current project to a new team. Each project shall have one owner, but the members are not limited. Editing can be done by the owner as well as by the team members. The owner can manage the notifications coming in by each of the members. The notification settings will receive alerts every time a status has been changed or updated, and when a message is received. The status updated by the project owner would reflect in the notification list of every team member conversely. </p>
                <h3>Team Channel Visual Boards</h3>
                <p>Visual boards grasp your attention, and keep you hooked to the tasks and the overall workflow of the project. Save all your data in one place and easily drag and drop tasks to picturize the work progress. We minimize the investment of your time by cutting down your requirement to search for documents online, as all the documents will be saved securely and can be accessed easily at any point of time. Track the number of hours spent on each project and the time invested by each team member and convert this data into meaningful insights. </p>
                <h3>Team Channel Messenger</h3>
                <p>Every business requires a sophisticated tool to communicate with your teammates, brainstorm ideas, to identify resolutions, and to administer projects. Chat messengers are not just tools - they are a contemporary office. Strong Communication is allied to a strong culture, and all organizations are different and so is their culture, this is probably the reason chat messengers are emerging rapidly in the market.</p>

Data needs to be pulled out from multiple files and platforms. This process gets more intricate when it requires collaboration with other teammates to prepare this report.
